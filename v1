# COVID-19 Portfolio Project

Hi there! This project is part of my learning journey using SQL to analyze COVID-19 data. I worked with real datasets covering global COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. It was a great way for me to improve my skills in writing SQL queries and making sense of large data.

---

## What I Used

- **Tool**: MySQL (Workbench)
- **Data Sources**: COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations from Our World in Data
- **What I practiced**:
  - Cleaning data
  - Joining tables
  - Writing subqueries and CTEs
  - Using window functions
  - Creating views

---

## Some Things I Found

- The number of people vaccinated in different countries
- Rolling totals of vaccinations over time
- How many people got infected compared to how many died
- Which countries had the highest death and infection rates

## What‚Äôs Inside This Repo

- `covid_deaths.csv` ‚Äì Raw data on COVID-19 deaths  
- `covid_vaccinations.csv` ‚Äì Data on vaccinations  
- `covid_portfolio_project.sql` ‚Äì All the SQL queries I wrote  
- `README.md` ‚Äì This file

## How to Try It

1. Import the CSV files into MySQL  
2. Open the SQL script and run the queries step by step  
3. Explore the views or tweak the queries however you like
